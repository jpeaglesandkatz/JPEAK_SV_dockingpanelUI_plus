Some personal scaling changes to the Docking UI and all sub panels (inventory/ equipment and such).. Since well personally I don't really like the HUGE fonts..

It changes the dark gray resource stash category titles and equipment titles to brighter and more visible color...

If you want just the more destinct stash titles and not the scaling just set the scaling factor in the .cfg (or via Bepinex Configuration manager) to 1.0

Always backup your savegames before using any mod

Installation: copy the .dlll file into your Star Valor/Bepinex/plugins folder
and play
